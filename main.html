	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I am passionate about technology and creating solutions that positively impact people's lives. As a developer, I would have the opportunity to build innovative applications and bring ideas to life through creative coding. I am constantly seeking to expand my programming skills in order to solve complex problems and deliver efficient, user-friendly products. My motivation stems from knowing that software has the power to transform industries and connect people through technology. I want to actively contribute to shaping the technological landscape rather than just consuming it. In short, I am driven to become a developer so I can use my analytical skills to develop solutions that empower businesses and users alike.</p>
